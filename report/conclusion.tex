\section{Conclusion}
After implementing serial logging and batch logging and gathering results for these algorithms, it is clear that exisiting logging algorithms have worked on smaller data sets in the past but are becoming out of date. As data sets grow, these algorithms are not efficient or scalable enough to keep up with the growth of data. Although more optimization are still being implemented for these two algorithms, the results are expected to be the same. \par

This makes the demand for new logging algorithm, parallel logging, even greater. Results are still being gathered, but it is predicted that this new process will be more effiecient and scalable. The key insights explain in this paper have lead to the discovery of parallel logging, a new alorithm that can change the efficieny of current database logging.
