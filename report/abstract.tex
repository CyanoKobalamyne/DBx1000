Logging is a vital part of ensuring system dependency and mitigating the damage of potential system crashes. However, with an exponentially increasing amount of critical data being processed on a daily basis, such as with ATM transactions or online retail sales, the need for better logging algorithms arises. We establish a baseline with serial logging using the widely-implemented ARIES protocol, and then compare it with two new algorithms that we developed called batch logging and parallel logging. Our results show that Batch logging was faster than series logging, but had the drawback of increased latency. Parallel logging achieved the best in both worlds with faster processing and no increase in latency.
