\section{Evaluation}


The original goal of the project is to create a scalable logging algorithm that does not act as a bottleneck for the database as a whole. The data shown below was collected to determine the scalability of the algorithm. 

Four algorithms were tested to generate these results. The first is a generic serial logging algorithm, the second is a serial logging algorithm with certain optimizations put in place, the third is the batch logging algorithm, and the last is a parallel logging algorithm. These different aAll of these are explained in further detail earlier in this paper. \newline

The results shown indicate the amount of time one txn would take to log. The goal is to minimize the amount the time increases as the thread count increases, indicating high scalability and preventing logging from becoming a bottleneck. Each of the four algorithms was tested on a maximum of 10000 txns and buffer sizes ranging from 10 to 100. 10 tests were run for each buffer size, and the average of these 10 test are shown below. \newline
